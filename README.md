# Kaggle-LANL

This repository contains all logic that resulted in an 11th place finish in the [Kaggle LANL competition to predict laboratory earthquakes](https://www.kaggle.com/c/LANL-Earthquake-Prediction/overview).

Please consider the [Kaggle forum post](https://www.kaggle.com/c/LANL-Earthquake-Prediction/discussion/94363#latest-547303) as a starting point for my solution.

There is a lot of logic so let me try to summarize it briefly:

- **EDA** folder contains some preliminary analysis
- **Hyperparameter analysis** anlayzes hyperparameter settings for sweeps of LightGBM and Neural network experiments.
- **Logic** contains the bulk of the approach, most of which is written in Python.
